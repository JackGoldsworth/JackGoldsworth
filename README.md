### Hi, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

I am software developer that loves solving problems and learning new things. Currently, I am a Junior at Iowa State University majoring in Software Engineering. I fell in love with programming when I was fourteen while making Minecraft plugins, and I decided to turn my hobby into a career. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently busy with school but hope to return to personal projects shortly.
