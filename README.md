### Hi, I'm Jack 👋

I am software developer that loves solving problems and learning new things. Currently, I am a Junior at Iowa State University majoring in Software Engineering. I fell in love with programming when I was fourteen while making Minecraft plugins, and I decided to turn my hobby into a career. 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an Imperitive Programming Language called Sciens.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++ and Programming Language Theory.
