### Hi, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

I am software developer that loves solving problems and learning new things. I fell in love with programming when I was fourteen while making Minecraft plugins, and I decided to turn my hobby into a career. 

- ðŸ”­ Currently busy with work. Maybe I'll get back to personal projects eventually...
